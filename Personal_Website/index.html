      <h2>Skills</h2>
	  <!-- First Skill -->

        <img class="code-img" src="images/coding.jpg" alt="code-img">

        <h3>Web and Software Development</h3>
        <p>I am an electrical engineer but I started developing passion for coding when I saw how exciting, beneficiary, and innovative programming was. As the world evolves, everything is becoming digital and intelligent. The secret behind this is development of software to be embedded in or installed on a hardware. I know frontend development, backend development, android, iOS, Command Lind, and python.</p>

	  <!-- Second Skill -->
	  <div class="skill-row">
		<img class="code-img" src="images/networking.jpg" alt="code-img">

        <h3>Computer Networking</h3>
		<p>If I were to add a minor to my major, computer science and engineering would have been that course. I developed passion for computer networking because because of it's closeness to my major field (telecommunications). Like programming, it is exciting when you're are building and configuring a network. My specific skills under this broad field are, building and configuring, LAN, VLAN, and WLAN, IP subnetting, CCNA routing and switching, Linux Operating Systems, windows software update service server operations, and Microsoft software center configuration management.</p>

	  <!-- Third Skill -->
	  <div class="skill-row">
	  <img class="code-img" src="images/wiring.jpg" alt="code-img">
	  
		<h3>Residential Wiring</h3>
		<p>I learned this skill when I was in my freshman year. Wiring is an essential skill that makes one marketable. Atleast, I have 5 years of part-time and daily hiring experience in this skill.</p>

        <h3>What I am mostly passionate about?</h3>
		<h2><strong>Telecommunications - Mobile Network<strong></h2>
        <p>Without telecommunications, we cannot communicate with our family and friends over long distances. We also won't be able to get information about daily happenings arouind the world. I layed more emphasis on it during my bachelor's program. I have atleast one and half year experience in this field. I am intending to futher my studies in this field.</p>
